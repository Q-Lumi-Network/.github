In Dec 2022, I got selected as a fellow in the Lumi IGNITE Fellowship Program; An Innovation fellowship designed to nurture young adults (8-18) into unique problem solvers utilizing the Design Thinking Methodology.

In applications developed in this repo I assume the persona of a Luminaire (fancy term for Lumi's young Innovators): As I work my way through building an App to solve a real-world problem (*****) using - </p>
                                 
<h2 align="center"> Lumi's Design Thinking Methodology for Real-World Problem Solving: </h2>

This repository is dedicated to building innovative applications that solve real-world problems using the design thinking methodology. Our goal is to create user-centered solutions that positively impacts the needs and desires of our target group.

<h4> Empathize </h4>
The first stage of the design thinking methodology is to empathize with the users. We will conduct user research and gather insights into the needs and problems of our target audience. This stage involves conducting interviews, surveys, and observations to gain a deep understanding of the user's perspective.

<h4>Define</h4>
Based on the insights gained from the empathize stage, we will define the core problem to be solved. We will use various tools, such as journey maps and personas, to synthesize the information gathered from users and identify the key challenges that need to be addressed.

<h4>Ideate</h4>
The third stage of the design thinking methodology involves ideating potential solutions to the problem identified in the define stage. We will brainstorm ideas, use creative techniques, and generate a wide range of potential solutions.

<h4>Prototype</h4>
Once we have generated potential solutions, we will create physical or digital prototypes to test and refine our ideas. We will use low-fidelity prototypes to quickly iterate and refine our solutions based on feedback from users.

<h4>Test</h4>
The final stage of the design thinking methodology involves testing the prototypes with users to gather feedback and refine the solution. We will iterate on the prototype based on the feedback gathered from users to arrive at a workable solution.

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
This repository is organized into folders based on applications built so far. Each folder contains documentation, resources, and tools specific to that application. We encourage collaboration and feedback from our community to help us create the most effective solutions possible.

Thank you for your interest in our repository, and we look forward to working with you to tackle real-world problems using the design thinking methodology.

<h3>Applications</h3>
Our applications aim to tackle a range of real-world problems, including healthcare, education, and sustainability. Here are a few examples of the applications we have developed:
